# We may have different projects in our system that may require different package dependencies.
# Your project1 may have pandas version 2.1 whereas project2 may have pandas version 2.5 in the same system
# So, this arises a problem. If you want to work on project1 then one of packages must be uninstalled from
    # your global system and another version should be installed

# This problem can be solved creating a virtual environments in your system
# Virtual Environment is an isolated environment to keep the packages required for your project.
# It solves the problem of installing and uninstalling packages for different projects in a same system

# Every python project must be done with a virtual environment activated


# Commands for Virtual Environment
1. python -m venv <environment_name>
    => This command creates a new virtual environment (for this session lets say "venv")

2. venv\Scripts\activate (for widows device enter this command in command prompt)
   source venv/bin/activate (for mac and linux devices)
    => This command activates the virtual environment

3. deactivate
    => This deactivates the virtual environment
4. pip freeze
    => It displays all the packages installed in the environment

5. pip freeze > requirements.txt
    => Add all the dependencies of the project in requirements.txt file
6. pip install -r requirements.txt
    => Recursively installs all the packages in the virtual environment
