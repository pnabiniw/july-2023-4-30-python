# Like in other programming languages, python also has its own data-types.
# 1. Numbers => Immutable
# 2. Boolean => Immutable
# 3. List => Mutable
# 4. Tuple => Immutable
# 5. String => Immutable
# 6. Dictionary => Mutable
# 7. Set => Mutable

# Three things must be kept in mind while studying data types
# 1. Operators
# 2. Methods
# 3. Built-in functions

# Except numbers and boolean, other types in python are sequential.
# E.g. List, set, dictionary, tuple and string


########## Mutable and Immutable Objects #############
# If an object once created can be altered in its life period then it is mutable data-type.
# Examples of mutable objects are list, dictionary and set.
# But if an object once created can never be altered then it is an immutable object
# Examples of immutable objects are integer, float, boolean, tuple and string
