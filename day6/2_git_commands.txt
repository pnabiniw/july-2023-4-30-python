1. git config --global user.name <your-username>
   => Configures the git global username in local (your system or laptop)

2. git config --global user.email <your-email>
    => Configures the git global email in local (your system or laptop)

The above commands are only one time for a local system.

3. git config --global user.name
4. git config --global user.email

5. git init
    => initializes a repository in the local
    => Should not be used multiple times in a same project

# .gitignore
    => If we do not intend to upload any file or folder from the local repo to the remote repo, then
    such files and folders name are kept (name mention) in .gitignore file.
    => git ignore file should be named exactly ".gitignore"

6. git status
    => Shows the current status of the local repo i.e any changes that need to be added, committed,
    pushed or pulled

7. git add .
    => Adds all the changes to the git. This is done exactly before committing the code.

8. git commit -m "<commit-message>"

9. git branch
    => shows all the branches and highlights the current branch

10. git branch -M main
    => Makes "main" branch as the root branch

11. git remote add origin <ssh-link>
    => adds a remote with name 'origin' in the local repo

12. git push -u origin main

    git push => uploads your code to github
    -u => this tracks your local branch upstream with remote
    origin => alias name for remote (github)
    main => Remote "main" branch

  The significance of -u (tracking the upstream) is that we can write "git push" only from next time
  onward. Otherwise, we should write "git push origin main" everytime.
