What is Version Control ?
=> There can be different versions of the same project which should be backward compatible.
=> These different versions of the same project is maintained by a version control system
=> There are different version control systems like git, mercurial etc. Git is the most famous one


Why to use a version control system?
=> To maintain project versions efficiently and with less manual work
=> For effective team collaboration

=> The project maintained with version control system is later uploaded somewhere in the cloud.
=> There are several cloud storage services like google drive, onedrive, S3. But these storage systems
    do not cooperate with version control (e.g. git)
=> So we should use such cloud services which understand version control. There are several such services
    for example, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket etc.
